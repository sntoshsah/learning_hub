Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in lightweight, portable containers. Since you're using Ubuntu, Docker works seamlessly with Linux-based systems.

Key Docker Concepts

- Container: A lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run an application.

- mage: A template used to create containers. It contains the application code and dependencies.

- Dockerfile: A script that contains instructions to build a Docker image.
- Volume: A way to persist data outside the container’s lifecycle.
- Network: Allows communication between containers.
- Docker Hub: A cloud-based registry to store and share Docker images.

Installing Docker on Ubuntu

Run the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
```
Verify installation:
```bash
docker --version
```
To enable and start Docker:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```
To allow running Docker without sudo:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```
Basic Docker Commands

1. Working with Images

Search for images on Docker Hub:
```bash
docker search ubuntu
```

Download an image:
```bash
docker pull ubuntu
```
List downloaded images:
```bash
docker images
```
Remove an image:
```bash
docker rmi image_id
```
2. Working with Containers

Run a container interactively:
```bash
docker run -it ubuntu bash
```
Run a container in the background:
```bash
docker run -d --name my_container ubuntu
```
List running containers:
```bash
docker ps
```
List all containers (including stopped ones):
```bash
docker ps -a
```
Stop a running container:
```bash
docker stop container_id
```
Remove a container:
```bash
docker rm container_id
```
View container logs:
```bash
docker logs container_id
```
3. Building Custom Images

Create a Dockerfile:
```yml
# Use Ubuntu as the base image
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install necessary packages
RUN apt update && apt install -y python3

# Set the default command
CMD ["python3", "--version"]
```
Build an image:
```bash
docker build -t my_custom_image .
```
Run a container from the custom image:
```bash
docker run my_custom_image
```
4. Managing Volumes (Persistent Storage)

Create a volume:
```bash
docker volume create my_volume
```
Mount a volume to a container:
```bash
docker run -v my_volume:/data ubuntu
```
5. Networking in Docker

List available networks:
```bash
docker network ls
```
Create a new network:
```bash
docker network create my_network
```
Run a container in a network:
```bash
docker run --network my_network --name container1 ubuntu
```

## Docker vs Docker Compose

Both Docker and Docker Compose help in containerization, but they serve different purposes.
1. Docker:

Docker is a tool that allows you to build, run, and manage containers.
It operates at the container level (one container at a time).
Requires you to manually start, stop, and configure containers.

Example: Running a single container
```bash
docker run -d --name my_app -p 5000:5000 my_image
```
2. Docker Compose:

Docker Compose is a tool for managing multiple containers as a single application.
Uses a YAML file (docker-compose.yml) to define and configure services.
Simplifies the process of starting and stopping multi-container applications.

Example: Running multiple containers with Docker Compose

Instead of running multiple docker run commands, define everything in a docker-compose.yml file.

docker-compose.yml
```yml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: my_app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
```
Run the entire stack with:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Stop all services with:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

|Feature |	Docker	| Docker Compose|
|--------|----------|----------------|
|Scope|	Single container|	Multi-container applications|
|Configuration	|Command-line flags|	YAML file (docker-compose.yml)|
|Startup Command|	docker run|	docker-compose up|
|Scaling	|Manual	Built-in scaling|(docker-compose up --scale app=3)|
|Best for|	Simple apps	|Complex, multi-container setups|

When to Use Which?

    Use Docker for single-container applications or quick testing.
    Use Docker Compose when dealing with multiple services (e.g., app + database + cache).

Docker Compose Syntax & Rules

A docker-compose.yml file is used to define multi-container applications. It follows YAML syntax and consists of structured sections.
Basic Syntax

version: '3'  # Specify Docker Compose version
services:
  service_name:
    image: image_name  # Use an existing image or build from Dockerfile
    build: ./path-to-dockerfile  # (Optional) Build an image from a Dockerfile
    container_name: custom_name  # (Optional) Name the container
    restart: always  # Restart policy (always, unless-stopped, on-failure, no)
    ports:
      - "host_port:container_port"  # Expose ports
    environment:
      - VAR_NAME=value  # Environment variables
    volumes:
      - host_path:container_path  # Mount volumes
    networks:
      - my_network  # Connect to a custom network
    depends_on:
      - other_service  # Define dependencies

networks:
  my_network:  # Define a custom network

volumes:
  my_volume:  # Define a named volume

Rules for Writing a Docker Compose File

    Use Correct Indentation
        YAML is indentation-sensitive (use spaces, not tabs).
    Define the Version
        Use a supported Docker Compose version (e.g., '3', '3.8').
    List Services Under services:
        Each container (service) must be defined under the services: section.
    Use Proper Data Types
        Strings: "string_value"
        Integers: 123
        Booleans: true or false
        Lists: - item1
    Use ports: Correctly
        "8000:80" → Maps host port 8000 to container port 80.
    Use volumes: for Persistent Data
        /data inside a container should map to a host directory or a named volume.
    Define networks: for Container Communication
        Containers on the same network can communicate using service names.

Example: Running a Flask App with PostgreSQL
docker-compose.yml

version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    container_name: flask_app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/mydatabase
    networks:
      - app_network

  db:
    image: postgres
    container_name: postgres_db
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
    volumes:
      - pg_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - app_network

networks:
  app_network:

volumes:
  pg_data:

How to Use Docker Compose

    Start Services (detached mode):

docker-compose up -d

Stop Services:

docker-compose down

View Running Containers:

docker-compose ps

Check Logs:

docker-compose logs -f

Rebuild the Images (if changes are made):

    docker-compose up --build
