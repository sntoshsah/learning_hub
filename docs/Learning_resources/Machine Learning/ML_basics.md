## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that focuses on creating systems that can learn and make decisions without explicit programming. These systems analyze data, identify patterns, and improve their performance with experience.

For example:
- Predicting stock prices.
- Detecting spam emails.
- Recommending products online.

## Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning can be categorized into three main types based on the learning process:

### 1. **Supervised Learning**
- **Definition**: The algorithm learns from labeled data (input-output pairs).
- **Example**: Predicting house prices based on features like area and location.
- **Common Algorithms**: 
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Neural Networks

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Definition**: The algorithm identifies patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Example**: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.
- **Common Algorithms**:
    - K-Means Clustering
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Definition**: The system learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
- **Example**: Training a robot to walk or play games like chess.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - Agents
    - Actions
    - Rewards

## Life Cycle of a Machine Learning Project

A successful ML project follows these steps:

1. **Problem Definition**: 
    - Define the business or research objective.
    - Example: "Can we predict customer churn?"

2. **Data Collection**:
    - Gather relevant data from various sources.
    - Example: Sales records, user activity logs.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize data.
    - Example: Converting categorical data into numeric form.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Select, transform, and create features to improve model performance.
    - Example: Adding a new feature like "age group" derived from "date of birth."

5. **Model Training**:
    - Train the model using algorithms like Regression, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks.
    - Example: Using a linear regression model to predict house prices.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score to validate performance.

7. **Deployment**:
    - Deploy the trained model into a real-world environment.

8. **Monitoring**:
    - Continuously monitor the modelâ€™s performance and update as needed.
