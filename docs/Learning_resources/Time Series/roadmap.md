🔰 Phase 1: Foundations of Time Series
✅ Topics:

    What is a Time Series?

    Components of Time Series:

        Trend

        Seasonality

        Cyclicity

        Noise (residuals)

    Time Series vs Cross-Sectional Data

    Stationarity & White Noise

✅ Math/Stats:

    Basic statistics: mean, median, variance

    Covariance, autocorrelation

    Lag and difference operations

✅ Tools:

    Python, Jupyter Notebooks

    Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

✅ Practice:
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

ts = pd.read_csv("air_passengers.csv", parse_dates=['Month'], index_col='Month')
ts.plot()
plt.show()
```

📊 Phase 2: Exploratory Time Series Analysis (TSA)
✅ Topics:

    Plotting time series data

    Rolling statistics (moving average, std)

    ACF (Autocorrelation Function) & PACF (Partial ACF)

    Seasonal decomposition (additive vs multiplicative)

✅ Tools:

    statsmodels.tsa, scipy.signal

✅ Code Sample:
```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose

result = seasonal_decompose(ts, model='multiplicative')
result.plot()
```
🧪 Phase 3: Time Series Preprocessing
✅ Topics:

    Handling missing timestamps

    Resampling (up-sampling, down-sampling)

    Lag features, rolling features

    Differencing to remove trend/seasonality

    Stationarity check (ADF/KPSS test)

✅ Code:
```python
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

adf_result = adfuller(ts['#Passengers'])
print(f'p-value: {adf_result[1]}')
```
🔁 Phase 4: Classical Time Series Models
✅ Models:

    AR (AutoRegressive)

    MA (Moving Average)

    ARMA, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

    SARIMA / SARIMAX (seasonal ARIMA + exogenous vars)

    Exponential Smoothing (ETS)

✅ Concepts:

    Model Order Selection (AIC/BIC)

    Model Diagnostics

    Forecasting & Confidence Intervals

✅ Tools:

    statsmodels.tsa.arima_model, pmdarima

✅ Code:
```python
from pmdarima import auto_arima

model = auto_arima(ts, seasonal=True, m=12)
model.summary()
```
🧠 Phase 5: Machine Learning for Time Series
✅ Techniques:

    Train/Test split in time series (walk-forward validation)

    Feature engineering (lag/rolling windows)

    ML Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

    Multi-step forecasting

✅ Tools:

    scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm

✅ Code:
```
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Create lag features
df['lag1'] = df['value'].shift(1)
df.dropna(inplace=True)

model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(df[['lag1']], df['value'])
```
🧠 Phase 6: Deep Learning for Time Series
✅ Models:

    RNN

    LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

    GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)

    1D CNNs for time series

    Transformer-based models (e.g., Time2Vec, Temporal Fusion Transformer)

✅ Tools:

    TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch

✅ Code Sample:
```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```
🔍 Phase 7: Model Evaluation & Forecasting
✅ Metrics:

    MAE, RMSE, MAPE

    Cross-validation for time series (e.g., TimeSeriesSplit)

    Visualize forecast vs actual

    Prediction intervals

✅ Code:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae}')
```
🗂️ Phase 8: Advanced Topics
✅ Topics:

    Anomaly Detection in Time Series

    Time Series Clustering

    Multivariate Time Series

    Exogenous variables (SARIMAX, VAR)

    Forecasting with missing data

    Probabilistic Forecasting

✅ Libraries:

    Facebook Prophet

    NeuralProphet

    darts (uniting classical + DL models)

    GluonTS, Kats, Nixtla

🚀 Phase 9: Project Ideas

    Stock Price Forecasting (with LSTM & ARIMA)

    Electricity Load Forecasting

    Sales Forecasting for E-Commerce

    Weather Time Series Analysis

    Air Quality Index (AQI) Forecasting

    IoT Sensor Time Series Monitoring
