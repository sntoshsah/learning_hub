# Encapsulation in Python

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is the mechanism of restricting access to certain details of an object and exposing only essential features. This concept helps protect an objectâ€™s integrity by preventing unintended interference and misuse of its data.

Encapsulation is implemented in Python by:
1. Defining public, protected, and private attributes.
2. Using getter and setter methods to access and modify private attributes.

## **1. Public Attributes**
Public attributes are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.

#### Syntax:
```python
class ClassName:
    def __init__(self):
        self.public_attribute = "Accessible everywhere"

# Accessing public attribute
obj = ClassName()
print(obj.public_attribute)
```

#### Example:
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Public attribute

person = Person("Alice")
print(person.name)  # Output: Alice
```

---

## **2. Protected Attributes**
Protected attributes are indicated by a single underscore (`_`) prefix. They are intended to be used within the class and its subclasses, but can still be accessed directly if needed (not strictly enforced).

#### Syntax:
```python
class ClassName:
    def __init__(self):
        self._protected_attribute = "Accessible within class and subclasses"
```

#### Example:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, species):
        self._species = species  # Protected attribute

    def get_species(self):
        return self._species

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"I am a {self._species}. Woof!"

dog = Dog("Canine")
print(dog.get_species())  # Output: Canine
print(dog.speak())        # Output: I am a Canine. Woof!
```

---

## **3. Private Attributes**
Private attributes are indicated by a double underscore (`__`) prefix. They are only accessible within the class and are not directly accessible from outside the class.

#### Syntax:
```python
class ClassName:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__private_attribute = "Accessible only within the class"
```

#### Example:
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

account = BankAccount(1000)
account.deposit(500)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500

# Attempting to access private attribute directly
# print(account.__balance)  # Raises AttributeError
```

---

## **4. Getter and Setter Methods**
Getter and setter methods are used to access and modify private attributes while maintaining control over how the data is manipulated.

#### Syntax:
```python
class ClassName:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__attribute = value

    def get_attribute(self):
        return self.__attribute

    def set_attribute(self, value):
        self.__attribute = value
```

#### Example:
```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, salary):
        self.__salary = salary  # Private attribute

    def get_salary(self):
        return self.__salary

    def set_salary(self, value):
        if value > 0:
            self.__salary = value
        else:
            raise ValueError("Salary must be positive")

employee = Employee(5000)
print(employee.get_salary())  # Output: 5000

employee.set_salary(6000)
print(employee.get_salary())  # Output: 6000

# employee.set_salary(-100)  # Raises ValueError
```

## **Benefits of Encapsulation**
1. **Data Protection:** Prevents unauthorized access and modification of data.
2. **Modularity:** Makes the class more modular and manageable.
3. **Ease of Maintenance:** Changes to encapsulated code do not affect other parts of the program.
4. **Controlled Access:** Provides controlled access through methods like getters and setters.

Encapsulation ensures the integrity and security of the data while providing the flexibility to modify implementations without affecting external code.
