# Ring and Basic Properties

## Definition of a Ring
A **ring** is a set \( R \) equipped with two binary operations: addition (+) and multiplication (\( \cdot \)) such that:

1. \( (R, +) \) is an abelian group (i.e., it satisfies closure, associativity, identity, inverses, and commutativity under addition).
2. \( (R, \cdot) \) is a semigroup (i.e., it satisfies closure and associativity under multiplication).
3. Distributive properties hold:
    - \( a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c) \)
    - \( (a + b) \cdot c = (a \cdot c) + (b \cdot c) \)

### Examples
1. \( \mathbb{Z} \): Integers under addition and multiplication form a ring.
2. \( \mathbb{R}[x] \): Polynomials with real coefficients form a ring under standard addition and multiplication.

### Non-Examples
1. Natural numbers \( \mathbb{N} \) under addition and multiplication are not a ring because they lack additive inverses.

## Properties of Rings

### Types of Rings

### Commutative Ring
A ring \( R \) is commutative if multiplication is commutative:

\[
\forall a, b \in R, \quad a \cdot b = b \cdot a
\]

### Ring with Unity
A ring \( R \) has a **multiplicative identity** (unity) if there exists \( 1 \in R \) such that:

\[
1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a \quad \forall a \in R
\]

### Division Ring
A ring \( R \) is a division ring if every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.

### Zero Divisors
An element \( a \in R \) is a zero divisor if:

\[
\exists b \neq 0 \in R, \quad a \cdot b = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad b \cdot a = 0
\]

### Integral Domain
A commutative ring \( R \) with no zero divisors is an **integral domain**.

### Example: Verify Properties
- **Set**: \( \mathbb{Z}_6 \) under addition and multiplication modulo 6.
- Check if it satisfies the ring properties.

### Solution
1. Closure: \( a + b \mod 6 \) and \( a \cdot b \mod 6 \) remain in \( \mathbb{Z}_6 \).
2. Associativity: Both addition and multiplication are associative.
3. Distributivity: Holds by modular arithmetic rules.
4. Zero divisors: \( 2 \cdot 3 \mod 6 = 0 \).
   - Hence, \( \mathbb{Z}_6 \) is not an integral domain.

## Field

### Definition of a Field
A **field** is a commutative ring \( F \) with unity where every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse:

\[
\forall a \in F, a \neq 0, \quad \exists b \in F \text{ such that } a \cdot b = 1
\]

### Examples
1. \( \mathbb{Q} \): Rational numbers under standard addition and multiplication.
2. \( \mathbb{R} \): Real numbers under standard addition and multiplication.
3. \( \mathbb{Z}_p \): Integers modulo a prime \( p \), where addition and multiplication modulo \( p \) form a field.

### Non-Examples
1. \( \mathbb{Z} \): Integers are not a field because most elements lack multiplicative inverses.

### Field Properties
1. Addition and multiplication are commutative.
2. Distributive property holds.
3. Every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.

### Applications
1. **Cryptography**: Fields like \( \mathbb{Z}_p \) are used in RSA and elliptic curve cryptography.
2. **Linear Algebra**: Vector spaces require a field for scalar multiplication.

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Check Zero Divisors**: To determine if a ring is an integral domain, verify there are no zero divisors.
2. **Prime Modulo**: For fields \( \mathbb{Z}_p \), ensure \( p \) is prime.
3. **Unity Element**: Always confirm the presence of a multiplicative identity when analyzing rings and fields.
4. **Inverse Element**: In fields, test the existence of multiplicative inverses for all nonzero elements.
